\begin{abstract}
There are many different frameworks available to create a web application. One of them is Node Js which has exploded in popularity in recent years \cite{lei2014performance} \cite{borges2015popularity}. Another option is using a service, which allows the developer to not touch any server side code, for example Database as a Service (DaaS). To study and compare a server side framework to DaaS, we used benchmarks for performance metrics and scalability. Representatives are Node Js for web application frameworks and Firebase Realtime Database for DaaS. The goal is to visualize the advantages and disadvantages for each.
